# University of Waikato Design Show Website

This website was made as a concept for the 2024 University of Waikato Design Show , as part of a social media package including a website, video banners and posters etc

I developed it myself along with the video banners and animations used on the website.
The student details along with their projects were supplied as POC data from the previous year.
