let bioText = "Hi, I'm Sinuo Feng from Guangzhou, China. My hobbies include films and video games. When I was working in Guangzhou, I was fortunate enough to work for a number of companies as a graphic designer and photographer, among other positions, and gained a wealth of design experience.<br>As a graphic designer, I have been involved in designing a variety of media including brochures, posters, logos, website interfaces and more. I am passionate about translating creative concepts into visual art, ensuring that each project captures the interest and resonates with the audience. My experience working in photography has also given me a deep understanding of the power of images. I have worked as a photographer, capturing a variety of subjects, from landscapes to portraits, as well as product photography. Through the lens, I've learned to capture moments and enhance photos through post-processing to meet the needs of my clients.<br>My love for film and video games stems from the pursuit of storytelling and creativity. Watching films and participating in video games is my way of relaxing and inspiring creativity. Not only do these media provide entertainment, but they also provide me with artistic and design inspiration that helps me stay creative in my design work.";
let productDescText = "Our project aims to inspire university students to get involved in conservation action by presenting the situation and conservation needs of the Kakapo through video. The Kakapo is a rare and endangered New Zealand bird that faces habitat loss and predator threats. We chose university students as our target audience because they represent a dynamic young generation with the potential to become conservation leaders. By educating them about the importance of the kakapo, we hope to inspire them to get involved to ensure the future of the kakapo. Our main media tool is a video that will vividly demonstrate the characteristics, threats and conservation measures of the Kakapo, while emphasising the important role of university students in conservation efforts. Through this video project, we hope to raise awareness and encourage university students to become actively involved in kakapo conservation. This is vital to ensure the balance and health of New Zealand's ecosystems.";
