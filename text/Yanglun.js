The blend of my Eastern roots and Kiwi upbringing has shaped my unique perspective.<br>I'm a passionate student of Interface Design at the University of Waikato, and my journey here has been both challenging and inspiring. With graduation on the horizon at the end of this year, I'm excited to bring my design skills to the forefront.<br>Outside of my studies, I'm really into UI and UX design. It's my big passion!

let productDescText = "My project is focused on creating a website to empower young adults in New Zealand to embrace a smoke-free lifestyle. I'm targeting individuals between 18 to 24 years old.<br>I chose to design this project because I want to address the critical issue of smoking among young adults in New Zealand. This age group is often susceptible to peer pressure and other influences that can lead to smoking. I believe that by providing them with the right information and support, I can help them make healthier choices.<br>The website will deliver essential information about the dangers of smoking and the benefits of quitting. It will also provide resources and a supportive online community for young adults on their journey to becoming smoke-free.";
