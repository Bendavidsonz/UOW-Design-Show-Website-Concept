let bioText = "Hi, my name is Bella. I am based in Hamilton but grew up on a dairy farm, just under the Kaimai Ranges. My interests include reading, writing, baking and of course, designing. My three years of studying a Bachelor of Design have been my favourite three years of my life. The amount I have learnt in such a small time not only in regards to design, but about myself, is immeasurable. I have loved the range of projects we have worked on and am grateful for the lecturers and tutors that have drawn out in me this creativity and deep love for design.";
let productDescText = "Welcome to Noted. This publication has been designed to teach people to write creatively. While people of any age group could benefit from this, the publication has been created with those between the ages of 18 â€“ 22 in mind. I have considered them in my styling, layout, colour, type and example choices. Majority of people in this category have left high school and creative writing is not something everyone goes on to learn about. Because it is something I have pursued and carried on with into my University studies, through an English minor, I feel this project helps solve a problem that not many people in that age group know about the different creative writing techniques. Noted includes 10 different creative writing techniques, the definition of each, why they are important to use in writing and an example. On the final page is a pocket containing a flash card for each technique, these have been designed as a study aid. Noted is for anyone wishing to learn about a range of creative writing techniques to add description to their own writing.";
