let bioText = "Hi there, my name is Harper, and I come from the beautiful China. The first spark of my passion for design was ignited in high school. Under the guidance of my teacher and my exploration, my interest in interface design has been stimulated, and my passion for designing is not limited to simply finishing the design but love to consider different perspectives. Studying at the University of Waikato honed my design skills and provided me with valuable opportunities to collaborate with fellow students.<br>These collaborative efforts have greatly enriched my design perspective. In addition, I was lucky enough to join Grey Street Kitchen as an intern during my internship course. I designed UI/UX and other related products for the cafe there. This experience further solidified my design foundation and gave me a deeper understanding of the field I am passionate about.";
let productDescText = "For this project, I designed the \"Young Defenders of Aotearoa\" app. Technology plays a key role in shaping young minds in the digital age. Our decision to develop this app stemmed from our desire to make learning about New Zealand's endangered species engaging and informative.<br>We believe that by introducing children to the wonders of native species through interactive media that is familiar to them, we can raise a new generation of conservationists. The app educates and encourages users to actively participate in conservation efforts by supporting DOC's programs.";
