let bioText = "Bonjour! I'm Paris, no I am not from France...I’m a bubbly, family-oriented individual who grew up in a creative cozy home in the Bay of Plenty. From a young age, I was surrounded by the arts and inspirational people who ignited my love for all things creative. Whether it was the world of dance, music, photography, or art, I explored various pathways. However, one dream has always held me captivated – designing my own business.<br>Throughout my course, I refined my skills and found my identity as a designer. I explored my unique style, how I express my ideas, and design principles that resonate with me. This self-discovery significantly influenced my capstone project. It reflects my family centric values, draws from my childhood experiences while paying tribute to my creative roots and my journey to becoming a well-rounded designer.";
let productDescText = "In our digital age, the term 'iPad kid' is used to describe those deeply reliant on screens for everyday tasks. Excessive screen time, particularly among children, poses concerns for mental health, physical fitness, and relationships. I have personally witnessed the consequences of this unhealthy screen habit and so I have focused on assisting parents in navigating their kids' tech-life balance.<br>I designed the ‘Wonder Wanderers’ brand that delivers personalized kits that encourage tech-free fun and meaningful bonding experiences. Our core objectives include cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. To achieve this, I created the ‘Adventure Kit’ for children aged 6-8. It features a versatile adventure bag with attachable, collectable objects, a monthly activity booklet along with other cool surprises.";
