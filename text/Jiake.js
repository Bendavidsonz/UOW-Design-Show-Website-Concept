let bioText = "Hello dear visitor, thank you for coming. Please allow me to give a brief introduction. I am an international student from China. My interest has been painting since I was a child, so when I was studying abroad, I chose design, a major that combines both practicality and artistry. I feel that design not only includes my own understanding and pursuit of art. What's more important is the need to communicate with people from all walks of life to achieve our common pursuit of better things.";
let productDescText = "Do you know what \"Kākāpō\" is? Do you know how many there are now?<br>This project will introduce you to Kākāpō, this mysterious and adorable little guy. Nowadays, people are paying more and more attention to environmental issues and species protection. But \"Kākāpō\" are not well understood because they only grow in New Zealand. So, I chose the theme of protecting Kākāpō. I hope more people can understand and recognize this lovely creature. At the same time, I hope Kākāpō can benefit from it and get more help and attention. My major is communication design, so my preferred way of expression is information visualization posters and posters to introduce this creature. In addition, I also designed some cartoon images and peripheral products about Kākāpō to introduce and display them.";
