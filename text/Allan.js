let bioText = "<p>Hello, I am Allan. I grew up on a farm in the king country before moving to Hamilton. I'm a fan of video games, digital media, computers, art and design. I always enjoyed working with and on computers to pursue creative pursuits like drawing, modeling, animating, and coding and wanted to further my knowledge in these areas.</p><p>I originally studied information technology in the past but decided I wanted to explore the design side of things to expand my knowledge of how people interact with the world to create better experiences. Over my studies I have strengthened my knowledge not only in the field of media design but also branched out into experimenting with interface and industrial design, which has given me a greater appreciation for how we utilize human skills combined with technology.</p>";
let productDescText = "<p>Fill in the blank is a project about period poverty, especially in relation to young girls in the school environment. Each group member provided a unique perspective and approach to providing solutions in the form of resources for students and teachers and the design of a 3D printable dispensary for tampon products for placement within the school environment to improve access to the products.</p><p>For my contribution to the project, I decided to create a 3D printable dispenser system designed for tampons. I chose to create this as the easiest way I saw to give access to health products was to design something inexpensive, modular, easy to create and assemble and cheap to distribute that could be donated to schools.</p>";
