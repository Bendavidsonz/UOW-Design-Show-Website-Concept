let bioText = "Greetings, my name is Armelle Tran. I'm an international student from Hanoi, up from the Northern Hemisphere of Vietnam. Currently, I'm in my final undergraduate year of study in Media Design.<br>A passion I have is telling stories through visuals, hence finding a liking for animation and storyboarding. Placing a character in different situations and envisioning how the story unfolds is a fixation I have.<br>I signed up for this degree with much confusion despite the goal of making animations or dealing with posters and banners. The studies on design have very much extended my perspective towards design and my career orientation.";
let productDescText = "I stumbled a lot during my time on the campus and as I recovered and finished my papers, I found burnout as an inspiration. Burnout rides below the surface of my time as a student and until in university, I realised what terrorised me.<br>Procrastination, anxiety, fatigue and stress are what students get in the 21st century. A lot of these signs lie under the term \"burnout\" and to my surprise, not every struggling student knows their limit before their stamina exhaustively drops. Popular resources show how one could get away from burnout, but not how one may deal with it. This is when my project comes in to inform the audience about burnout in university and show ways that one could recover.<br>The aesthetic of the shorts takes an example from cel animation and pencil sketches to depict an unfinished, bleak and indefinite feel of dread. The project is a series promising 6 short episodes depicting how a student recovers while in her mind lingers the taste of a previous fall. Each short depicts what a \"too much\" moment might look like, then follows a possible alleviation to help our character, ending with a positive \"too much\" (pun intended).";
