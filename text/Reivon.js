let bioText = "Yo!<br>My design journey started when my art journey ended. I knew that art wasn’t going to pay the bills and that the future is in technology so I started looking at potential study options. I almost got sucked into Computer Science when I found Interface Design and the more I read about it the more I liked it. It is a doorway into the tech industry while also allowing me to express myself and be creative.<br>After three years, I can say that I do not regret it and that it was actually fun and interesting. I have learnt a lot in both design and code and I am now excited to put them to use.";
let productDescText = "Cardiovascular health is something most young adults only worry about when serious health issues start popping up. Healthy Hearts is a website that provides relative information about the risks of developing cardiovascular diseases in the form of a risk calculator. Something as easy as a three-step assessment can raise your awareness of your health and your risk of developing issues and diseases.<br>After being tasked with designing and developing a project aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals, I knew I wanted to do something for health and fitness. I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to show my growth so I decided to expand on my previous experience with risk calculators. I used my newly learnt skills in React and applied my collection of design knowledge to show how far I’ve come.";
