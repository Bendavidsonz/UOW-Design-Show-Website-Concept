let bioText = "<p>Hello!</p><p>My name is Adam Ettema, I was born in Hamilton and have lived a considerable amount of my life here, except for a small stint in Raglan to chase my surfing dreams… It didn’t work out... Anyway, I love everything adventure, whether that’s sports, golf, running or chasing sunsets, a lot of my time is spent outdoors. On the flip side, I am extremely passionate about all things design, I tend to spend quite some hours scrolling around YouTube tutorials or saving epic work on Instagram. I enjoy branding, publication and print, and would classify those as my strong suits. I am punctual, cooperative and lots of fun!";
let productDescText = "<p>Entering high school was a challenge I’m sure many people can relate to. Starting off in this big new school not knowing many people felt like a nightmare. But it shouldn’t be like that… right?</p><p>Helping Unleash Brilliance or “HUB” is a campaign targeted towards year 9 and 10 male students who may struggle in school, the students who may feel as though they are lagging behind. I have chosen this target audience as many of these students, just as I did, feel like a small fish in a big sea and can’t get the help they need.</p><p>Using the VARK learning styles I create a range of designs to help these students understand the way they learn. The VARK learning styles refer to visual, auditory, read/write and kinaesthetic learning styles all of which have different characteristics in the way you understand and retain knowledge. Year 9 and 10 shouldn’t be about pen on paper regurgitating notes, but instead setting you up for success with NCEA. If a student can understand the way that they learn, this will save many future headaches. I wanted to design this in a way that is appealing to students and not just another poster on a wall, instead an engaging piece of design work.</p>";
