Coming from the Philippines, a place where creativity thrives, I've always had a deep passion for the arts, whether it’s painting, drawing, or even dancing. I'm fortunate to be surrounded by people who encourage and inspire my creativity.<br>Throughout my studies, I’ve enjoyed exploring the intersections of technology and creativity. I like to believe that I can help bridge the gap between computer science and design, combining the precision of code with the endless possibilities of artistic expression. Over the past 3 years, I’ve developed a passion for UI/UX design and front-end development, which I hope to continue in my career.";
