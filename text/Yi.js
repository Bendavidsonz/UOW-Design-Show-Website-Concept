let bioText = "Hello there! I hail from the vast and culturally rich landscape of China. Gaming and soccer are my twin passions, allowing me both digital adventures and real-world athletic pursuits. I've always been fascinated by the way interfaces connect us to the digital world, be it a website or an app. It's this passion that led me to specialize in interface design.<br>My hands-on experience includes a delightful project earlier this year where I crafted a website for 'Pukeko Preschool'. Designing interactive spaces that are both engaging and efficient is a journey I thoroughly enjoy.";
let productDescText = "Project's Essence: This design project revolves around creating an informative and engaging platform for two distinct yet interconnected target audiences: children aged 5-12 and adults aged 30-35, primarily parents and educators. Our aim is to bridge the gap of understanding and exploration between these groups, focusing on endangered species.<br>The core of the project is split into two components. The first, a pop-up book and animation, is tailored for children, feeding their innate curiosity and thirst for knowledge. The second, a website and application, is curated for parents and educators. This dual approach ensures that both young explorers and their guiding stars can journey together.<br>I chose to engage in this project due to its multifaceted nature. It's not just about presenting information; it's about crafting experiences that cater to diverse age groups. I saw this as an opportunity to meld my design expertise with a purpose that resonates - creating awareness about endangered species.<br>While the entire project was a collaborative endeavor, I took charge of the website component. Given the importance of parents and educators in imparting values and knowledge to children, I aimed to create a digital space that is informative yet intuitive for them.<br>By fusing my interface design skills with the objectives of this project, my hope is that we can foster a sense of responsibility and curiosity among our users, leading them to be champions of our world's endangered species.";
