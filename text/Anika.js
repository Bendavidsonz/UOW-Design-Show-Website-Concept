let bioText = "<p>Kia Ora, I am Anika, a designer bought up in Tauranga, NZ. My journey in design stems from my love for all things creative, from art to cooking and even makeup. From as long as I can remember, there has always been a paintbrush in my hand. I was introduced to design in year 12 and have been in love with it ever since.</p><p>Before leaving high school, I was introduced to interface design by my career’s advisor. I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn something new while also expressing my creative side. This decision has not only allowed me to learn something new but also to channel my artistic inclinations into a field that constantly challenges and inspires me.</p><p>Throughout my degree, I have learnt a lot about design and myself as a designer. I designed a website for two clients in my last year which has enriched my skillset and provided a real-world taste of the design industry. As a result, I've made the exciting decision to continue my journey in the realm of UI design.</p>";
let productDescText = "<p>Soul Script, an anxiety relief app tailor-made for New Zealanders, seeks to address a common challenge we all face—dealing with anxiety. Anxiety is a natural emotion experienced by every one of us. However, anxiety disorders, characterised by intense anxiety that significantly affects our daily lives, are expected to impact approximately one in four New Zealanders at some point during their lifetimes. With the concerning rise in mental distress over time, there's a growing demand for accessible tools that can assist people in managing their anxiety. I decided to design this app because I have personally grappled with anxiety, and I've seen loved one’s struggle with it as well. Therefore, I was motivated to create an app that we could all find genuinely beneficial.</p><p>This app offers a diverse set of tools to help users alleviate anxiety, including features like journaling, meditation sessions, gratitude practices, motivational quotes, message prompts, and affirmations. The main feature of Soul Script is the journaling category. The journaling category provides a secure space for users to delve into their thoughts and emotions and practice gratitude.</p><p>n the app's home page, each category is distinguished by its own illustration, inspired by overseas holidays, and related to the particular category. This design choice serves the purpose of helping users distinguish between categories while also providing a sense of calm and relaxation. The intention behind this approach is to allow users to discreetly use the anxiety app without drawing attention to it and create an atmosphere that is calming.</p>";
