let bioText = "Hello, my name is Nick Hall. I’m a Theatre and Media major from Cambridge, with an interest in performing, video editing, and film studies. I first attended the University of Waikato way back in 2014, where I learnt how to read the language of film. Now, I’ve returned to further develop my practical skills, including camera operation, interview, and editing.<br>In the last two years alone, I’ve created a vector art collage of Hamilton graffiti, an interactive children’s picture book, a mental health awareness media campaign, and much more. Now, I’m learning to write with the language of film, rather than just reading it.";
let productDescText = "Wake Up and Feed Me! is a touching, informative, and adorable documentary that explores the ways in which Support Animals can enrich and improve our physical and mental wellbeing. Whether it’s through disability support, therapy, or even a simple reminder to get out of bed in the morning, our furry friends are there to lend a claw, hoof, or paw.<br>Using a deeply personal, participatory style of documentary presentation, Wake Up and Feed Me! examines three different facets of animal support, from three different species of animals. The film embraces a soft, dreamlike atmosphere while maintaining the authenticity that viewers expect of documentary films.>br>My goal with this documentary is to showcase the hard work that Support Animal organizations do every day to improve the lives of those who need it. I hope that the documentary will spread awareness of the support available in Aotearoa to people who could benefit from it the most.";
