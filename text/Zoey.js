let bioText = "Hi there, my name is Xiaoqing Chu. I am from Tianjin, a city in northeastern China. I have been studying in New Zealand since 2016, and the experience of studying design there has been fascinating. It has enriched my knowledge and broadened my horizons.<br>I have a deep interest in reading, listening to music, and editing videos. My first experience with video editing was when I worked for the TV channel at my junior high school. Based on that experience, I believe that video editing is my dream job.<br>During my time at university, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge in various areas that will enable me to create different types of media works. I will continue to study in this area in the future.";
let productDescText = "Young Defenders of Aotearoa (YDA) is a collaborative design project aimed at promoting the preservation of New Zealand's unique wildlife. Our project takes inspiration and information from the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC).<br>Within this plan, our team has chosen five species from DOC's species-specific programs: Kākāpō, Takahē, Whio, Pekapeka, and Hector's and Māui dolphin. Our primary audience comprises children, their parents, and teachers.<br>The goal of this project is to raise awareness among children and early educators about endangered native species, with the goal of generating public interest in these precious creatures. Our team has used a range of design mediums. To make the animation part attractive to young audiences, we've given the animals a voice. The animal characters introduce themselves and offer information about their species. The concept for these animations will be a series of animations, each focusing on one of our team's selected animal groups. As the final product, I have completed the Pekapeka animation, which serves as a sample episode from this series.";
