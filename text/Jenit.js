let bioText = "Namaskaram, my name is Jenit Mathew, and I am originally from Kerala, India, but I have lived in Hamilton, New Zealand, since I was eight years old. I have always been fascinated by computers as a young girl, however it wasn't until I was in year seven that I was introduced to digital technology and design. From there, I was exposed to web design and graphic design, and it soon became my dream to study it further. I am also interested in media; films and music are two of my main interests because I love how it allows me to daydream and escape my reality.<br> Throughout my almost three years of studying design, I have learned a lot of things, but my most significant and best memories are from designing outcomes that can improve a user's satisfaction. For example, during my university internship, I designed a movable office sign to help display employee's whereabouts throughout the day. I also designed a library-based app in one of my design classes, to motivate people to read more and socialize with other book lovers. These digital outcomes allowed a problem to be solved, I hope in the future I can do more of this.";
let productDescText = "Fill in the blank is a project created by Jenit Mathew, Allan Ormsby, and Peiyi Wu that spreads awareness against period poverty and educates for period related problems in New Zealand, especially in relation to young girls in the school environment. In this project we created various types of media for helping females access hygiene products and being well-educated on their period related problems. We chose to design this because we would like to contribute to gender equality and take it as a challenge on how to build a campaign. Each group member provided a unique perspective and approach to providing solutions in the form of resources for students and teachers. The project deliverable package is a branding design involved in products, media and print material.<br> Our brand packing content: <ul><li>A website for community (Jenit)</li><li>Posters for promote our branding and spread awareness of ‘no period shame’ (Peiyi)</li><li>Social media post(s) for social media application (Jenit)</li><li>A design of a 3D printable dispensary for tampon products for placement within the school environment to improve access to the products (Allan)</li><li>Printable infographics brochures that can be used in school for education purposes.
