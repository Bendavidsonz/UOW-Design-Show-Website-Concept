let bioText = "Hi everyone, my name is Peiyi Wu. I'm an international student from Guangzhou, the southern part of China. I came to New Zealand in 2015. After that, I completed my high school in Auckland and embarked on a new chapter in my life, beginning my university studies at the University of Waikato.<br>\u2018There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes\u2019, and welcome to my world of design, I strive to create a canvas where a thousand possibilities come to life.<br> My major is Communication Design. This means I have the opportunity to work with various types of media related to communication. After freelancing as a traditional Chinese clothing designer for two years, I decided to dedicate more time to my university studies, focusing on improving my skills in creating successful products while also adding commercial value. I've always believed that good design can create significant value and be adapted to our lives.<br> I have developed a range of different skills during my studies, including branding design(print media, photography, online marketing), web design (user interface UI, user experience UE, and web programming), and creative programming.<br>Between my second and third years of study, I worked as a website builder and designer to create a website for a local business(All Pass Drive School Hamilton). And I was also employed as design technician, providing various forms of support, including designing the elements, editing, and proofreading for a textbook series produced by the University of Waikato.";
let productDescText = "Fill in the blank is a project created by Jenit Mathew, Allan Ormsby, and Peiyi Wu that spreads awareness against period poverty and educates for period related problems in New Zealand, especially in relation to young girls in the school environment. In this project we created various types of media for helping females access hygiene products and being well-educated on their period related problems. We chose to design this because we would like to contribute to gender equality and take it as a challenge on how to build a campaign. Each group member provided a unique perspective and approach to providing solutions in the form of resources for students and teachers. The project deliverable package is a branding design involved in products, media and print material.<br> Our brand packing content: <ul><li>A website for community (Jenit)</li><li>Posters for promote our branding and spread awareness of ‘no period shame’ (Peiyi)</li><li>Social media post(s) for social media application (Jenit)</li><li>A design of a 3D printable dispensary for tampon products for placement within the school environment to improve access to the products (Allan)</li><li>Printable infographics brochures that can be used in school for education purposes.
