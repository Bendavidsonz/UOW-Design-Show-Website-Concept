let bioText = "Hello everyone, my name is MingzeMa. I started to like design after designing and making my own display cabinets in the Wood tec class in high school. In life, I love collecting Hot Wheels toys. For this reason I always spend my free time figuring out how to display my toys. I design backgrounds for them and display them. <br>During my second year of uni I worked part-time at a Chinese restaurant. I designed the menu for that restaurant and did the layout according to the boss's request. I made money through design for the first time.";
let productDescText = "There are still two years until New Zealand becomes completely smoke-free by 2025. At the same time, I found that my classmates who I met in high school did not smoke, but now they started smoking, which made me feel incredible. At the same time, based on conversations with them, I found that most people do not understand the dangers of smoking and that smoking is just fun. So I plan to publicize the dangers of smoking through the methods I am good at, and I also set the target users to be students between the ages of 16 and 22.<br>For this purpose, I extracted its elements and colors based on the recently popular movie \"Barbie\". However, in order to avoid copyright disputes, I changed the character logo and did not include the \"Barbie\" logo in the design work. At the same time, in order to highlight the equality between men and women, I also extracted the color matching of \"ken\". Three posters, three social media posts and a promotional brochure were designed for each color scheme. I hope this awareness campaign educates my peers about the dangers of smoking.";
