let bioText = "Kia Ora! I’m Jay and I am currently in my final year of design at the University of Waikato. I grew up in Tokoroa and attended Forest View High School. Writing this biography seems like a full circle moment. I had begun University in 2019 and graduated in 2020 with a Diploma in Law, but always desired taking a more creative route and turn the artistic flare I had into something more. I pursued my design passions in 2021, not having any design experience whatsoever.<br>My knowledge on digital drawing/ animation and Adobe software were limited. My degree has given me so many opportunities. I have been able to take on freelancing projects, while given the chance to complete a design/ marketing internship for The Gallagher Chiefs HQ. My confidence in my craft and the craft itself has exceeded what I believed myself to be capable of. My advice to anyone choosing a career path is to simply go for what you want, work hard and what you want will come to you.";
