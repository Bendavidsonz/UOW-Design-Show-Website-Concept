let productDescText = "Impersonate is a short film that follows the story of two people and their battle with depression and whether they can overcome the hurdle or fall into despair. Me and my group mate Suwan went with this theme as we thought it would be a relatable topic for people around our age (18-25), especially in the modern world.<br>With stress and personal circumstances, people tend to fall into depression quickly, but they fake being okay and put on a fake smile for the rest of the world to see, to show that they are not weak, but in reality, they just need a helping hand. The title of the film was inspired by a quote from late actor and comedian Robin Williams “People don’t fake depression; they fake being ok”. Impersonate is not just a story it’s also a message.";
